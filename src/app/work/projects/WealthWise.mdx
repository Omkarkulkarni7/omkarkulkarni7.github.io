## Overview

**WealthWise** is a stock investment and portfolio tracking platform that enables users to manage their financial assets efficiently. It provides real-time stock market data, investment tracking, and seamless transactions through a secure banking integration.

I built this platform using the **MERN stack**, leveraging **Alpha Vantage API** for real-time stock data and implementing **secure banking transactions** with dummy accounts. The platform ensures seamless user experience with a **Material UI frontend** and **optimized backend API**.

## Key Features

- **Stock Market Dashboard**: Displays real-time stock prices from NSE & BSE.
- **Investment Portfolio Management**: Users can track stocks they own and view profit/loss calculations.
- **Stock Trading (Buy/Sell)**: Users can invest in stocks using funds from their **dummy bank accounts**.
- **Secure Transactions**: Implements authentication & banking transactions securely.
- **Historical Data & Insights**: Users can view stock performance over time.
- **Material UI & Responsive Design**: Built with a modern UI for seamless navigation.

## Technologies Used

- **Tech Stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js)** – Full-stack implementation  
- **Sequelize ORM** – PostgreSQL database integration  
- **Alpha Vantage API** – Real-time stock data  
- **Material UI** – Clean and professional UI components  
- **JWT Authentication & OAuth** – Secure user authentication  
- **AWS (S3, EC2, RDS)** – Cloud hosting & database management  

## Challenges & Learnings

Building a **real-time stock tracking system** required handling frequent API calls efficiently. Implementing **caching mechanisms** and optimizing database queries helped ensure smooth performance. Additionally, handling **secure banking transactions** involved designing robust validation mechanisms.

## Outcome

WealthWise is now a **fully functional investment platform**, offering users a seamless way to manage stocks and portfolios. With real-time stock data and secure banking integration, it helps investors **make informed decisions** effortlessly.
