## Overview

This project involved redesigning and developing the official website for **Safety Saarthi**, a fire system installation company. The goal was to enhance user experience, improve performance, and ensure seamless deployment using cloud technologies. 

I started by **redesigning the website in Figma**, focusing on a modern, intuitive UI/UX. Then, I built the frontend using **Angular** for a dynamic and responsive experience. The website was deployed using **AWS services** for optimal performance and scalability.

## Key Features

- **Modern UI/UX Redesign**: Created a professional and user-friendly design in Figma.
- **Built with Angular**: Developed a fast, scalable frontend using Angular’s component-based architecture.
- **AWS-Powered Hosting**: Utilized AWS services for secure and efficient deployment:
  - **S3** for static hosting  
  - **CloudFront** for content delivery  
  - **Route 53** for domain management  
  - **AWS Lambda** for email functions  

## Technologies Used

- **Figma** – UI/UX design & prototyping  
- **Angular** – Frontend framework for dynamic user interfaces  
- **AWS S3, CloudFront, Route 53, Lambda** – Scalable cloud hosting  
- **TypeScript & SCSS** – Clean, maintainable code structure  

## Challenges & Learnings

One of the main challenges was optimizing performance for a fast-loading experience. Using **CloudFront for caching** and **lazy loading Angular modules** helped achieve smooth performance. Additionally, integrating AWS services efficiently required setting up proper IAM roles and policies for security.

## Outcome

The redesigned Safety Saarthi website is now **live at [www.safetysaarthi.com](https://www.safetysaarthi.com)**, offering a professional, high-performance platform for customers to learn about fire safety solutions. The new design and AWS-powered infrastructure have improved both **usability** and **reliability**, helping the company establish a stronger digital presence.
