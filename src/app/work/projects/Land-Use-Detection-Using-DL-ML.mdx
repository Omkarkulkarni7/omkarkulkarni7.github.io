## Overview

This project focuses on land type classification using a hybrid approach combining deep learning and machine learning. We utilized the **UC Merced dataset** and **NASA satellite images**, leveraging **InceptionV3** for feature extraction and **Weka** for classification. The goal was to improve land-use monitoring through an accurate and scalable detection system.

## Key Features

- **Deep Learning Feature Extraction**: Used **InceptionV3** to extract deep features from satellite images, capturing high-level spatial patterns.
- **Texture Feature Analysis**: Extracted **GLCM-based texture features** (contrast, homogeneity, correlation) to enhance classification accuracy.
- **Machine Learning Classification**: Trained **LMT, RF, and RT** classifiers in **Weka**, achieving up to **98% accuracy** using **10-fold cross-validation**.
- **Web-Based Deployment**: Developed an interactive web interface allowing users to upload satellite images and receive land-type predictions.

## Technologies Used

- **InceptionV3**: Deep learning-based feature extractor for satellite imagery.
- **Weka**: Machine learning toolkit for classification and analysis.
- **GLCM (Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix)**: Texture feature extraction for improved classification accuracy.
- **Python & OpenCV**: For preprocessing and feature extraction.(Tensorflow)
- **Flask & React**: To build a web-based interface for real-time classification.

## Challenges and Learnings

- **High Dimensionality**: Managing large feature vectors from deep learning and texture extraction required dimensionality reduction techniques.
- **Data Generalization**: Ensuring the model performs well on different datasets, including **NASA Landsat images**.
- **Web Deployment**: Optimizing model inference time for a smooth user experience in a web environment.

## Outcome

This project successfully combined deep learning and machine learning to classify land types with **98% accuracy**. The web interface enables seamless interaction, allowing users to analyze satellite images effortlessly. Future improvements include **real-time data integration and cloud-based processing** to expand scalability.
